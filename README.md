# covid19_animal_shelter_analysis

The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted many industries, including municipal animal services. Animal shelters are intended to match animals with permanent homes, while providing a safe community for both animals and people.  The Covid-19 pandemic has challenged the City of Dallas’ Animal Services department to create new innovative strategies to meet the needs of the community.  This problem affects all Dallas residents and animals needing to be rehomed. A decline in animal services is first observed in March 2020 when the stay-at-home orders by county officials went into effect. This study will explore the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Dallas’ animal adoptions, surrenders, and impounds by observing trends and conducting a correlation analysis of Covid19 confirmed cases and animal services over time. The animal services data used for the study is obtained from the City of Dallas open data portal and the Dallas Covid-19 data is from USAFACTS. Inferences drawn from the study will be used to suggest recommendations and strategies to help Dallas Animal Services improve services through the continuation of the pandemic period.
